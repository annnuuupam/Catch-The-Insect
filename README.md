Project Description:

Catch The Insect is a simple, fun, and interactive web-based game where the player is challenged to catch virtual insects. The user chooses their "favorite" insect, and it appears randomly on the screen for the player to click on and "catch". As the player catches more insects, the score increases. The game also tracks the amount of time spent playing, and a playful message appears when the player reaches a score of 20.

The game interface is retro-themed and has a vibrant design, using playful fonts and insect images. The difficulty of the game ramps up as more insects begin appearing at faster rates, adding an element of challenge. The game encourages quick reflexes and precision to catch all the insects before they disappear!

Features:

  *Insect Selection: Players can choose between four different insects‚ÄîFly, Mosquito, Spider, or Roach‚Äîto catch.
  
  *Scoring System: Each successful insect catch increases the player's score by 1. A hidden message is displayed once the player reaches a score of 20.
  
  *Random Insect Movement: Insects appear randomly at different locations on the screen, making it more challenging for the player.
  
  *Timer: Tracks how long the player has been playing the game, displayed in MM format.
  
  *Responsive Design: The game adjusts to various screen sizes, making it playable on different devices.


Technologies Used:

  HTML: For structuring the game screens and elements.
  
  CSS: For styling the game with a retro look and responsive layout.
